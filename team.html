              Prior to Praesidium, Mr. Lasher was one of three members on the investment team at Sherborne Investors (“Sherborne”), a ‘turnaround’ activist investment firm with ~$700mm assets under management. In 2015, Barron’s ranked Sherborne the #1 global activist/event driven fund after considering returns to underlying partners. It remains among the top 10. Its success is partially attributed to the strategy of investing in companies that have underperformed due to operational rather than capital structure considerations.
